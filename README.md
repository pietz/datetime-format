# datetime-format
[WIP] Python code for efficiently extracting the datetime format from a string

Background story for this code is explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76355619/detect-the-format-of-a-datetime-string-in-python/76356143#76356143)

This is a rough, early, seemingly working, still untested implementation of what I needed. It's roughly 30x faster than using dateptime() to parse all kinds of possible datetime combinations.

PRs welcome. Not sure, how much time I will invest here.
